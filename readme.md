# HOME LAB

this is a repo for my home server
having self hosted `nextcloud`, `jellyfin` and `arr stack (radarr and stuff)`

## planing to self host

- [ ] Beeper Bridges
- [ ] Valt Warden (Bitwarden Selfhosted)

## Major Drawback

- doesn't have vpn config and stuff for the arr stack whle torrenting ip will be visible (too much work + me don't have vpn)
